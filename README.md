Proyect title : " Payment form with responsive input validation"


Implementation:

The foundational approach to this proyect is the usage of Reacts hooks in order to have controlled inputs and in that way be able to generate a functionality that responds to that input.

My basis was to build a Layout using bootstrap breking points to make sure that the design was also responsive accordingly to the monitor where it is displayed.

After building the lay-out I poceded to play around with the styles to search for something eye catcher but also sober. I was tempeted at first to build a darker design on with a clear back-ground but on a second thougth I decided to go with the usual white approach because this being a payment Layout its curcial that the information is bullet proof when it comes to readability iincluding people with low visibility. Therefore I decided to create a darker background to enhance the white layout as such.

When all this was done I proceded to create the funcionality inside my component. It is a very simple one and what it does is that it first sets a state and ties it to the input field of the credit card number and that allows me to "evaluate" this input so I can confirm that its format and length are the ones required for validation. So trough a very straight-forward conditional method I test the length of the recieved input and based on that I apply a CSS class that shows if the input is in the correct format or not. 
Finally I added and alert in case the user clicks in the interrogation sign next to the CCV required field so it tells the user where to find this number on its credit card.

Launching the project:

For this project to be launched its has to be verified that the NPM and NODE are properly intsalled and then just apply the ususal "npm start" on the terminal so a port is open and the result can be evaluated.

Thanks for the oportunity of participating in this challenge Im very new to the world of coding but it is slowly beacomming a great passion for me and its great to get this chances for learning and improving my skills!
